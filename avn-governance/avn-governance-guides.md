# Governance Guides

The following documentation covers how-to guides for using [AvN Governance](https://gov.aventus.io/)

## Setup

Anyone can watch AvN Governance proposals and votes take place via the webpage but in order to actually interact with the page you'll need two things to get started:

1. A browser-based web 3 wallet
2. AVT

On a desktop you have many options for browser-based wallet plugins and getting setup is typically a smooth progress. We support connections from: [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), [Coinbase Wallet](https://wallet.coinbase.com/), [Fortmatic](https://fortmatic.com/), [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.org/) & [Torus](https://toruswallet.io/). Once setup you can connect your wallet to the page and begin interacting directly.

To actively participate you'll also need some AVT in the wallet your connecting with. This can be purchased on an exchange like [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/) and then sent to your self-custody wallet.

## New Proposals

Proposals are a way to indicate a potential change to any aspect of the operation of the Aventus Network. The title describes the change in brief and each proposal has a full description for additional context along with multiple vote options.

For the meantime, only the Aventus team will be creating new proposals.

## Voting

Anyone with AVT can vote on active proposals.

## Viewing Results

All completed and historical proposals alongwith signed voting data can be seen at [gov.aventus.io/closed](https://gov.aventus.io/#/aventus.eth/closed).
