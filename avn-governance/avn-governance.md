# AvN Governance

The Aventus Network is designed as a decentralised layer 2 public blockchain on Ethereum. Decentralised ownership of the network will be facilitated via on-chain governance mechanisms using stake-based AVT token voting, allowing the participants of the network to decide its future.

## Vote Signalling

In its infancy the network is running as 10 controlled Aventus Validator nodes, and as per our roadmap, will open to external Validators in the near future. During this time off-chain network governance using secure and verifiable vote signalling is available to all AVT holders at [gov.aventus.io]().

Proposals can be initiated and voted on by anyone with AVT via this interface. AVT holders can submit 100% gas-less token-weighted votes on an active proposal to signal their preference of outcome, or create an entirely new proposal themselves. The result of proposals are easy to verify and hard to contest based on the cryptographic signatures provided by each participant. Proposal outcomes will be monitored by the Aventus team and implemented manually. For more infomation on exactly how to participate, read the [docs](~/avn-governance-guides.md)

Many AVT holders may already be staking their tokens in the Validator Registration contract to earn staking rewards so any votes cast from these addresses will also have their staked balance counted in their vote.

Aventus is utilising an open-source project called [Snapshot](https://github.com/balancer-labs/snapshot) by [Balancer Labs](https://balancer.finance/) to facilitate this.
