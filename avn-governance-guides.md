# Governance Guides

The following documentation covers how-to guides for using AvN Governance

## Setup

Anyone can create a new proposal for the Aventus Network, you'll need two things to get started:

1. A browser-based Ethereum wallet
2. AVT

On a desktop you have many options for browser-based wallet plugins and getting setup is typically a smooth progress. We support connections from: MetaMask, Coinbase, Fortmatic, WalletConnect & Torus. Once setup you can connect your wallet to the page and begin interacting directly.

To actively participate you'll also need some AVT in the wallet your connecting with. This can be purchased on an exchange like Ethfinex.
